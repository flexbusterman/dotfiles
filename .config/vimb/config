#
# header (list) # Comma separated list of headers that replaces default header sent by WebKit or new headers.  The format for the header list elements is ‘name[=[value]]'. Note that these headers will replace already existing headers.  If there is no '=' after the header name, then the complete header will be removed from the request, if the '=' is present means that the header value is set to empty value. Note that webkit reused already set headers in case of a reload of a page.  So if there are headers removed that where pre‐ viously  use  to access a certain page and the page is reloaded or opened via back/forward history the header will still be sent.  To apply the new header setting properly it's required to request another page  or  to  open  current  page  new  by ‘O<Cr>‘. To use '=' within a header value the value must be quoted like shown in Example for the Cookie header. :set header=DNT=1,User-Agent,Cookie='name=value' Send the 'Do Not Track' header with each request and remove the User-Agent Header completely from request.
#
# hint-follow-last (bool) # If on, vimb automatically follows the last remaining hint on the page.  If off hints are fired only if enter is pressed.
#

#
# hint-timeout (int) # Timeout before automatically following a non-unique numerical hint.  To disable auto fire of hints, set this value to 0.
#
# hint-keys (string) # The keys used to label and select hints.  With its default value, each hint has a unique label which can be typed to select it, while all other characters are used to filter hints based on their text.  With a value such as asdfg;lkjh, each hint is ‘labeled' based on the characters of the home row.			If  the  hint-keys  string  starts  with a '0' the keys are considered to follow the rules of numeric labeling. So that the			ifrst char of the label will never start with the '0'.			Note that the hint matching by label built of hint-keys is case sensitive.  In this vimb differs from some  other  browsers			that show hint labels in upper case, but match them lowercase.			To  have  upper case hint labels, it's possible to add following css to the ‘style.css' file in vimb's configuration direc‐			tory.			"span[vimbhint="label"] {text-transform: uppercase !important;}"
#
# hint-match-element (bool) # If this is set to 'true' typed chars that are not part of the set 'hint-keys' are used to filter  hinted  DOM  elements  by their  text  value.

#
